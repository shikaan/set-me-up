Installation scripts for any binary.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

`sup` is a set of simple and useful shell scripts that can be used to make your development workflow more efficient. These scripts provide one-liners that can be used to install or perform other common tasks on your binaries, and can easily be incorporated into your project's README.

`sup` works under the following assumptions binaries should be published as assets of a GitHub release and follow the naming convention "${BIN}-${OS}-${ARCH}" (e.g., "keydex-linux-amd64").

### Install

Executing the following command will install latest version of `mybin`

```sh
sudo sh -c "curl -s https://shikaan.github.io/sup/install | REPO=myuser/mybin sh -"
```

The name of the binary is inferred from the `REPO` variable. You can override it with `BIN`

```sh
sudo sh -c "curl -s https://shikaan.github.io/sup/install | REPO=myuser/myrepo BIN=mybin sh -"
```

### Uninstall

Same as above, but it will uninstall `mybin`

```sh
sudo sh -c "curl -s https://shikaan.github.io/sup/uninstall | REPO=myuser/mybin sh -"
```

Or, again, with the `BIN` override

```sh
sudo sh -c "curl -s https://shikaan.github.io/sup/uninstall | REPO=myuser/myrepo BIN=mybin sh -"
```
